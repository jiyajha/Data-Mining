The credit EDA case study aims to explore the application of exploratory data analysis (EDA) in the context of risk analytics in the banking and financial services industry. The objective of the study is to develop a basic understanding of how data is leveraged to minimize the risk of financial losses associated with lending to customers.

The dataset above is a collection of demographic and financial data on individuals who have applied for loans from a financial institution. The dataset contains information about the loan applicantâ€™s gender, age, employment status, education, family status, income, and other relevant factors.

The dataset has a total of 307,511 records and 122 columns. The columns contain a mix of categorical and numerical data, including features such as 'NAME_CONTRACT_TYPE' (whether the loan is a cash loan or a revolving loan), 'AMT_INCOME_TOTAL' (the applicant's income), 'OCCUPATION_TYPE' (the applicant's
occupation), and 'NAME_HOUSING_TYPE' (the type of housing the applicant lives in).

This dataset can be used to build predictive models to determine whether an individual's loan application should be approved or denied based on their financial and demographic characteristics. It can also be used for exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the demographics and financial status of loan applicants.
